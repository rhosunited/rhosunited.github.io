                <p class="lead">Rhos United Relics were invited to play some matches against Llandudno Strollers to enable a documentary video to made by <a href="https://www.s4c.cymru/">S4C</a> on Alan Camsell, their 92 year old, active goalkeeper.</p>
                <p class="lead">An extremely enjoyable evening for all, played in the right spirit. The sentiments explained in the video equally apply for the Rhos United players, who are perhaps reviving old careers and enjoy the team spirit of the game.</p>
                <p class="lead">For reference, 3 x 20 minute games were played with the scores (Rhos United first), 6-0, 0-2 and 1-1.</p>
