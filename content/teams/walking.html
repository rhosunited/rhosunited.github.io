                <p>Rhos United is happy to support a group who participate in Walking Football.</p>
                <p>This is a variation of the beautiful game aimed at men over 50 and ladies over 40. The group, affectionately known as the 'Relics' have been training once a week since early 2024.</p>
                <p>This year (2025) they are about to join a North Wales Walking Football League and have recently participated in their first North Wales cup competition.</p>

                <p>The group is inclusive and welcomes anybody to their weekly session. The training is undertaken outside on a 3G pitch. The main aim of the session is fun but recent people joining have described the group as 'very welcoming'.</p>
                <p>Alongside the obvious fitness benefits are the camaraderie and banter which all help with mental health. All abilities are catered for within the current group who range in age from 51 to 73.</p>
